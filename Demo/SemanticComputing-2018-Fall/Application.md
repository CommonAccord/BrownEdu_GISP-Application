Title of your GISP=Semantic Computing for the Arts and Sciences

GISP.Semester=Fall

GISP.Year=2018

IncludeTheTable=List of participants!!!

Purpose of your course=To study and participate in the development of an open source platform for semantic computing and a system of federated legal codes for contracts and other legal domains based on "Prose Objects" that is compatible with smart contracts, distributed access systems and blockchains.

Guiding questions={Question.Sec}

Question.Ti=Guiding Questions

Question.1.0.sec=How to make it easy for non-programmers to use programming tools and methods to find, use and create open source solutions to transacting and other non-programming domains.

Question.1.1.sec=Use of git.

Question.1.2.sec=Use of text editors and IDEs.

Question.1.3.sec=In what ways should the functions of the "Prose Object" format be extended?

Question.1.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

Question.2.0.sec=Formalization and generalization of the object model.

Question.2.1.sec=A formal expression of the object model, submission to a standards-setting organization (Kantara Initiative?).  Compatible in plain text (current), JSON, XML, databases, graph databases, IPLD(?), etc. 

Question.2.2.sec=Interfaces to existing transacting systems - Apttus, Oracle, Amazon, Paypal, Apple Pay, ....

Question.2.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

Question.3.0.sec=How can AI/NLP be used to:

Question.3.1.sec=Assist a person organizing a transaction (party, advisor, lawyer, intermediary) to find an appropriate offering and supplier, decide on a structure, decide on deal points, identify risks, schedule the events of performance, add the experience obtained from the transaction to their predictions in the future. 

Question.3.2.sec=Organize structured information (Prose Objects) from historical transacting resources, such as model agreement forms or transaction portfolios maintained in Contract Management Systems.

Question.3.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

Question.4.sec=What other efforts to open source transacting seem important, complementary, competitive?  Will these converge into a single platform like online converged into TCP/IP?  Zittrain "generative" element of collaboration.

Question.5.sec=To what extent can "law" be defined algorithmically?  Legalese, Lexon, Oliver Goodenough, Michael Genesereth, etc.  Do big data methods make this question moot -- all of transacting can be managed as patterns?  As self-driving systems are based on experience, perhaps all of legal can be a matter of identifying paths that usually work well and those that work less well.  Abuses (e.g., bias), inability to provide explanations, the HAL problem.

Question.6.0.sec=How to engage actors in the legal system to participate in creating and maintaining solutions?

Question.6.1.sec=The multitude of trade groups, arbitration associations, bar associations, model document projects and the like.  Notably the International Association for Contract and Commercial Management, the American Law Institute, EcoVadis, the FDA, National Venture Capital Association.  

Question.6.2.sec=The innovation forefront - LegalHackers, Accord Project, OpenLaw.io, ABA Innovation Center, etc.

Question.6.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

Question.7.0.sec=What are ideal object models for legal documents, drawing on the vast experience of legal drafters and the learning of software coding?

Question.7.1.sec=Inheritance from very general forms, modularity, etc.

Question.7.2.sec=Systematic use of "defined terms," of "schedules," etc.

Question.7.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

Question.8.sec=What governance systems for codified materials?  Public functions, civil society function, trade group function, commercial publishers, etc.  Law school and bar association participation?

Question.=[G/Z/ol/s8]

Goals of course=To bring together the very disparate strands of a single problem - how to effectively find and transact with others, define relationships and objectives and resolve disputes.

ScholarlyContext=This spans an extremely broad range of disciplines, from CS (semantic web, distributed computing, programming languages) to legal (document drafting, dispute resolution, governance)

TopicsWeeklySchedule=

CourseStructure=Each week will consist of the participants preparing for an interview with a specialist, conducting the interview (usually by video-conference), preparing responsive materials that add to the solution and presenting the solution to the expert in a second conference.

Impact=Systems of transacting absorb a vast amount of human energy and capital, and have tended to favor concentration.  A standards-based approach can radically reduce the friction and reduce the optimal size of "firms" (Coase).  This can help to improve real productivity and distribute power more widely.  There are currently important projects working in this direction.  Prose Objects, and the law seem able to unite many of these trends.  The GISP will contribute where it can, study and make recommendations to the University on the impacts of semantic computing.

Attraction=

CourseGap=There is no course that attempts to bridge computing and the law, nor any that focuses on Prose Objects as a solution.
